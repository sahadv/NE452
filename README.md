# Molecular Dynamics and Density Functional Theory Assigments from the course NE 452

## A1452Q1 
- Evaluates partition function for a single harmonic oscillator.

## A3NE452 
- Question 1 does Hartree-Fock Optimization for the energy and distance between two or six water molecules (water dimer or cage or prism isomer) for different basis sets.
- Question 2 performs Density Functional Theory Calculations on the same metrics and water molecule arrangments as Q1.


## A4NE452
- Performs metadynamics to obtain the optimal bond angles for the alanine dipeptide in water and vacuum.

## A5NE452 
- Question 1 performs path integral matrix multiplication for a single well harmonic oscillator to examine the free energy convergence and illustrate nuclear quantum effects. 
- Question 2 is the same as Q1 but for a double well harmonic oscillator.
